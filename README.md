# Sophie's Portfolio Website

## Website:

This website's purpose is to display my work as a full-stack developer, with a brief presentation, a skills set summary (at the moment, based on the programme syllabus!), a portfolio and a contact page to send a message and get in touch.

The "users" targeted with this website are recruiters, employers and also the web-development community.

## Features:

### Existing features:

- __Navigation Bar__

    - At the top of the page, the navigation bar displays a Logo made from my name's initial letters, this logo is also linked to the top of the home page, as a shortcut when moving to the other pages.
    - The other pages have links into the navbar too, they are in the right corner of the navigation bar: "Portfolio" and "Contact".
    - As the background color is in a dark grey, the menu items are well contrasted and easy to read.

### Features left to implement:

As this is too early to display many works, I've only added one (this Website) and added the link to the image. 

The other images come from Freepik and have the same link as the Project #1.

## Testing:

I've tested the website on Chrome and Firefox, I also used Chrome developer tools to check responsiveness.

I have also used mobile and different devises to see how the website looks on different screen sizes.

I have tested the form and check if all the required field are set-up correctly.

I confirmed that the Website and its functionnalities are working on all devises tested.

- Lighthouse
    - Performance is the main issue that has to be fixed on Portfolio and Contact pages. It was at 69% first, then resizing the images improved the performance that is now 90%
    - Accessibility is 95%. It was at 92% on the Home page (not enough contrast on the skills-set sectio) so I've changed the boxes colors to improve the score.
    - Best practices is 100%
    - SEO is 100%
